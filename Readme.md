# 🧠 LangChain LLMOps Project

This repository is a hands-on implementation of **LLMOps** using the **LangChain framework** — designed to explore how to build, deploy, and monitor Large Language Model (LLM) applications efficiently.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the **end-to-end lifecycle** of building an AI-powered application using **LangChain**, with a focus on operationalizing LLMs (Large Language Models) through modern MLOps practices.

Key areas covered:

* LLM pipeline development using **LangChain**
* Integration with **OpenAI** and other model providers
* Building modular **chains** and **agents**
* Experiment tracking with tools like **MLflow**
* Deployment-ready structure for scalable use
